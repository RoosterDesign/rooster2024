        <h2>{`Do we use cookies?`}</h2>
        <p>{`Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information`}</p>
        <p>{`We use cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`What are cookies?`}</h2>
        <p>{`Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term "cookies" in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.`}</p>
        <p>{`There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.`}</p>
        <p>{`Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to "remember me" when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won't collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites, or a user's general location.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`What are the advantages of cookies?`}</h2>
        <p>{`A cookie contains information linked from a web browser (the user) to a specific web server (the website). If a web browser accesses that web server again, the web server can read from and react to that information. Cookies ensure a user-friendly experience and support safety efforts for many online offers and services, e.g. language preferences, privacy settings, shopping baskets of online shops or relevant adverts.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`Do cookies pose a security or safety risk?`}</h2>
        <p>{`No, cookies do not pose any safety or security risks. They are not 'active', executable, software. They do not spy on data that is stored in the computer nor can they carry a virus.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`Is my privacy protected?`}</h2>
        <p>{`Usually cookies contain only a generic browser recognition or are associated with anonymous data. When cookies are set, the user is informed about it (typically in the privacy section of a website or in the terms of use or other user contract). If websites use cookies to collect personal data, data protection laws require those websites to inform users about the collection of personal data and the purpose of such collection.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`Can I control cookies?`}</h2>      
        <p>{`Yes, browsers offer cookie management setting tools (please see some help below). Browser settings can be set to require the user's confirmation for each cookie that might be stored on his / her PC. You can also set the browser to accept cookies only from specific web sites (e.g. your favourite news site). Browsers can also enable users to delete specific cookies. It is even possible to set a browser to reject all cookies. Note that choosing to disable all cookies could significantly affect your web browsing experience because many Internet services rely on cookies.`}</p>

        <p>{`Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of our website do not work properly.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`Can I disable a cookie?`}</h2>
        <p>{`Yes, some browsers will let you block just third party cookies (these are cookies placed on your browser by an entity other than the particular website's owner- e.g., an advertising partner) or will allow the use of settings to block only cookies that do not meet your privacy preferences. However, most Websites use cookies in order to enhance a user-friendly experience and the safety of their online offers, e.g. the shopping basket of an online shop or the display of a relevant advertisement. You can choose to disable all cookies but this could significantly affect your web browsing experience.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`What is the lifespan of a cookie?`}</h2>
        <p>{`Cookies are managed by web servers. The lifespan of a cookie can vary significantly, depending on its purpose. Some cookies are used only during an online session ('session cookies') and are not retained once you leave a website, and some cookies are retained and used each time you visit a website ('permanent cookies'). However, cookies can be deleted by a user at any given time through the browser settings.`}</p>
        <p>{`What kinds of cookies exist? There are two types of cookies: 'session cookies', which are automatically deleted after each session and 'permanent cookies', which have a longer life-span. Both kinds of cookies can be deleted at any given time by the user.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`What are third party cookies?`}</h2>
        <p>{`Some content on a Website can be placed by a third party provider (e.g. a news box ticker, a video or an advertisement). Those third parties can also place cookies through a Website and they are called 'third party' cookies because they are not the Website owner. Third party providers must of course respect the applicable legislation and typically the policies of the Website owner. See also question "Can I control cookies?".`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`Do cookies fill up my hard disk?`}</h2>
        <p>{`No, cookies are small text files and require very little storage.`}</p>
        
        <h2>{`What are flash cookies (or LSOs)?`}</h2>
        <p>{`'Flash cookies', referred to also as Local Shared Objects (LSOs), operate in a similar way to cookies and store preferred settings of players like Flash or Silverlight. In most cases, LSOs cannot be managed by browsers but through special manager tools:`}</p>
        <p>{`<strong>Adobe Settings Manager for LSOs using Flash Player</strong>`}</p>
        <p>{`<a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" title="Macromedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>`}</p>
        <p>{`The "Global Storage Settings panel" will allow you to choose how much disk space websites can use to store information for websites you have not visited yet (zero to unlimited). If you want to change the settings for the websites you have already visited, go to "Website Storage Settings Panel". You can choose the level of information storage for a website or delete the website so that, if you visit it again, it will use the global settings you have set under the "Global Storage Settings panel".`}</p>
        <p>{`<strong>Microsoft Settings Manager for LSOs using Silverlight</strong>`}</p>
